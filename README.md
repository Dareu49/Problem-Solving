# Problem Solving 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming problems, primarily from **Codeforces**, with plans to include **LeetCode** soon.

I’m currently solving problems in **C**, with plans to expand to **C++** as I progress.

## 🌐 Platforms
- 🟦 [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC) – Solving problems from this list.
- 🟨 LeetCode – planned for future inclusion

## My Codeforces Profile
- 🔗 [Dareu49](https://codeforces.com/profile/Dareu49)

## 🛠️ Languages
- ✅ C  
- 🧩 C++ – will be added progressively

## 💬 Commit Message Format
Each commit follows a consistent format for easy tracking:

**Example:**  
`Solve 4A - Watermelon [brute force, math]`

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `codeforces/`: Contains solutions to problems from Codeforces.
  - `C/`: Solutions written in C for problems from Codeforces.

## 📈 Goal
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Build consistent problem-solving habits by solving problems regularly.
- Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Explore different programming languages, starting with C and gradually adding C++ and more.
