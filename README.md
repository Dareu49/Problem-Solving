# Problem Solving 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming problems, primarily from **Codeforces** and **LeetCode**. I’m currently solving problems in **C**, with plans to expand to **C++** as I progress.

## 🏆 Number of Problems Solved (from April 2025)

- **Total**: 21
- **Codeforces**: 21
- **LeetCode**: 0

## 🎯 Target 2025

- **Total**: 175 problems
- **Codeforces**: 100 problems
- **LeetCode**: 75 problems

## 🌐 Platforms

- 🟦 **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)**  
  **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC)** - Currently solving problems from this list.  
  Codeforces problem set is ordered by the most solved problems in descending order.
